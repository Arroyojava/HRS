    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <!-- FAQ List -->
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>How much will my cabinets cost?</h4>
        <p>Cabinets vary dramatically in price just like cars or houses. Entry-level cabinets are less expensive than cabinets with special finishes and upgraded storage features. HDS provides cabinetry that fits most any budget—from basic to bold.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>How long will it take to get the cabinets I order?</h4>
        <p>Order time varies depending on the manufacturer and the complexity of the job. The minimum time is roughly three weeks and can be as much as eight weeks during peak times of the year.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Can you design my kitchen from a sketch of the room that I provide?</h4>
        <p>We can certainly start with a sketch you provide. Your forethought in doing some homework can shorten the time needed to design the final layout. However, we will always do our own measurements to verify that the design will actually work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>What is the best type of countertop for the kitchen?</h4>
        <p>There are many possible countertop choices. As with cabinets, your budget needs to be matched with your desire for flexibility of design and product longevity. Laminate, solid surface, quartz-enhanced, and granite are all good choices.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Can you match my existing cabinets or furniture?</h4>
        <p>All woods and stains change color over time—some more so than others. In many cases, HDS can find cabinetry that may be compatible with your existing cabinets or furniture. In no case can we guarantee an exact match.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>What construction features should I look for when choosing cabinets?</h4>
        <p>Certain construction features are a sign of quality cabinets. A savvy consumer will look for things such as finished backs in all cabinets, drawer guides that also support the drawer bottom, conversion varnish (not lacquer) finishes, multi-way adjustable hinges, adjustable shelves, and a wide range of heights and depths. Newer convenience features include “soft-close” hinges and drawers, multi-function drawer systems, and optional task lighting.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>What are the most popular types of cabinets?</h4>
        <p>While popular cabinet styles and trends vary from year to year, traditional raised-panel oak styling is always a favorite due to affordability and durability. A current trend is a “stand-alone” furniture look that allows for highly customized design features using cabinetry from major manufacturers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Are environmentally “green” cabinets available at a reasonable price?</h4>
        <p>HDS represents several manufacturers across the price spectrum whose cabinets are certified under the Environmental Stewardship Program developed by the KCMA (Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>What's the difference between manufactured cabinets and custom-made cabinets?</h4>
        <p>Years ago there was a significant difference in the sizes and finishes available from "custom" cabinetmakers and the "stock" manufacturers. Today, many cabinet manufacturers offer custom sizing and finishes that rival, and may even exceed, the possibilities of a local custom cabinet shop.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Do you charge a design fee, measure fee, or other fees in addition to the contract price for cabinets and installation?</h4>
        <p>HDS does not charge a measure fee or a design fee for a first design or estimate. In some cases, where multiple design revisions are requested, a design retainer may be requested. That retainer is then credited in full to the final cost of the job.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Do you do major remodeling?</h4>
        <p>HDS specializes in "light" kitchen, office, or laundry room remodeling. We have strong working relationships with several quality, full-line remodeling firms for those jobs that require major structural renovation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Do you provide cabinets for remodeling only, or also for new construction?</h4>
        <p>HDS works with a number of reputable remodelers and can provide cabinets through your contractor or directly to you for your kitchen or bath remodeling project or room addition. We also work with many custom home builders, who consult with our designers to assure that the layouts for kitchen cabinets, bath cabinets, laundry room cabinets, and other cabinetry are chosen to properly fit the budget and space. We will coordinate directly with your builder and also consult directly with you.</p>
