        <p>Home Renovation Systems (HRS) has contracted our team of IT systems professionals to design and implement a
            new comprehensive IT system for their company. They are looking to upgrade their existing system to include
            an active website, database, order-entry/inventory/employee system, VoIP system, security policy, and an
            integrated network (LAN and WAN) for their corporate locations.</p>

        <h3>HRS Historical Information</h3>
        <p>Founded in May 2007 by Joe and Emily Herold, Home Renovation Systems (HRS) began as a remodeling
            effort specializing in upgrading existing homes, particularly kitchens and bathrooms. Recognizing a
            significant
            demand in the greater Phoenix area, they established Home Renovation Systems as an LLC.
            Their first store was located at 101 Sedalia Drive, Phoenix, AZ. As the demand for their services grew, HRS
            expanded their team and offerings.
            In 2009, they opened a second location at 901 S. Sedona Way, Scottsdale, AZ.
            Over the next few years, the Scottsdale location expanded its team to include additional
            installation/renovation associates, an office manager,
            and a store manager who also handled sales and design work. In 2012, HRS continued its expansion by opening
            a third location in Tucson, AZ.
            Similar to the Scottsdale location, they hired all the employees for the Tucson location simultaneously,
            totaling 7 employees. This expansion helped HRS reach a broader customer base and strengthen its
            presence in the home renovation market. In June 2016, HRS took another significant step in its growth
            journey by acquiring two existing stores out of state.
            One of these stores, Elite Home Renovations in Las Vegas, NV, specializes in high-end appliances and
            bathrooms.
            The other store, IRB Home Supply in Albuquerque, NM, is a typical home supply store.
            These acquisitions expanded HRS's reach beyond Arizona and introduced them to new markets.
            Throughout its history, HRS has remained committed to quality and customer satisfaction.</p>
